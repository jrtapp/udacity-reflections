Reflect: Initializing a Repository
What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git creates a folder for the metadata to be stored to track commits and begins watching for commits.
So it can do its job.

Staging Area
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The working directory is an actual folder and the staging area is a virtual container.  The staging area provides a place to collect logically common files.
